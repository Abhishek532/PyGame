# PyJump
A simple Python "game" in which the character can freely move and jump and play around with portals displayed as colored boxes. 

## Overview
This **freshman** project was an attempt to extend my knowledge about programming and see what else I can do with Python. This was a simple attempt at a Mario-like game with an element of portals.

## Libraries Used 
I used the **pygame** library for this project because of it's simple syntax. I found the character images online and I animated them myself with a loop. Every time the character moves, the next movement image would get loaded and displayed. For the portal mechanics, I simply used **if** statements to check the character position and if a key(F) was pressed in that position, the character would jump ahead to the next portal, and vice-versa.
